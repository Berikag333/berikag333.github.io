    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <!-- 1-line personal tagline -->
    <p class="tagline">
      Turning marketing and customer data into clear, actionable business decisions.
    </p>

    <div class="about-text">
      <p>
        <strong>Based in Mexico City</strong>, I’m a <strong>Marketing & Data Analyst</strong>
        working at the intersection of data, marketing, and business strategy. My background
        blends marketing leadership, analytical rigor, and international experience, allowing
        me to translate complex datasets into insights that drive smarter decisions, sustainable
        growth, and measurable impact.
      </p>

      <p>
        I hold an <strong>MBA in Marketing</strong> and a
        <strong>Bachelor’s degree in Commercial Relations</strong>, and I’ve studied and worked
        abroad in Europe, collaborating with international teams across different markets and
        cultures. Living overseas shaped my ability to communicate clearly with diverse
        stakeholders, adapt quickly, and approach problems with a global mindset.
      </p>

      <p>
        Throughout my career, I’ve worked on projects spanning marketing performance analysis,
        customer behavior, experimentation, and strategic reporting—helping teams understand
        <em>what is happening</em>, <em>why it matters</em>, and <em>what to do next</em>. I
        specialize in turning analytics into action by combining rigorous analysis with clear
        storytelling, so insights are not just accurate, but decision-ready.
      </p>

      <p>
        Beyond data, I value balance and curiosity. I’m a dog lover, a tennis player, and I
        enjoy hiking with my dog—activities that keep me disciplined, focused, and energized,
        qualities I bring into my professional work as well.
